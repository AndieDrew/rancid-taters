## Abstract
Rancid Taters is a movie data base application that allows the user to select a movie from the list of movies, and see information relevant to the selected movie, including a link to a trailer. The application uses router to allow for a multi-page user experience with fully functional browser navigation arrows & refresh button.

## Learning Goals
* Using react to create a dynamically updating UI
* Using router to simulate a multi-page application.
* Using Cypress to test for multiple user flows.
* Make app responsive for mobile and tablet view.
