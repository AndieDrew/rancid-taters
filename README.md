## Overview

* Rancid Taters is a movie data base application that allows the user to select a movie from the list
of movies, and see information relevant to the selected movie, including a link to a trailer. The application
uses router to allow for a simulated multi-page user experience with fully functional navigation arrows.

# Learning goals

## Joint

* Using react to create a dynamically updating UI
* Using router to create a multi-page application.
* Using Cypress to test for multiple user flows.
* Make app responsive for mobile and tablet view.

## Individual

* Matt - Additionally I wanted to get more practice with responsive/mobile design.
* Andrew - Additionally I wanted to improve on conditional rendering and responsive design.

## Road Map

* Dashboard shows list of all movies using mock data
* A user can view a movies details
* Data is fetched from an API and mock data is no longer used
* Added router to simulate multiple pages
* Added cypress testing
* Added videos to details page and responsive design

##### Future Iterations Should Include:

* The ability to cycle through relevant movies
* Fully responsive design across multiple browsers.
* A search bar to search for movies.
